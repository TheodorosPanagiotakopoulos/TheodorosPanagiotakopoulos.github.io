<p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Theodoros Panagiotakopoulos</strong>, a <strong>Ph.D. physicist</strong> and <strong>computational modeling engineer</strong> with deep expertise in <strong>materials design</strong>, <strong>machine learning</strong>, and <strong>scientific software development</strong>. My work focuses on accelerating discovery in <strong>semiconductor fabrication</strong>, <strong>electrochemical systems</strong>, and <strong>nanotechnology</strong> by combining physics-based simulations with modern AI tools.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the <strong>University of Central Florida</strong>, my Ph.D. research centers on building <strong>machine learning pipelines</strong> and simulation frameworks to predict complex material behaviors with high accuracy and efficiency. I have developed <strong>deep learning models</strong> that outperform traditional DFT in speed, including <strong>convolutional neural networks trained on 3D voxel data</strong> to model metal-semiconductor deposition morphology. I have also built <strong>end-to-end pipelines</strong> for predicting atomic charge distribution, total energy, and final deposition structures, allowing scalable analysis for real-world systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    During my internship at <strong>ASML</strong>, I worked on next-generation <strong>computational lithography tools</strong>. I optimized <strong>FEM+</strong> and <strong>LMC+</strong> simulations within Tachyon, reducing <strong>memory usage by 34%</strong> and <strong>rounding runtime by 70%</strong>. My proposed simulation parameters produced more accurate contours, outperformed baseline values, and were integrated into <strong>ASML's latest release</strong>, now used by major customers. I also led a project to optimize <strong>Transition Cross Coefficients</strong> using <strong>M3D simulations</strong>, improving performance across mask types and numerical apertures.
  </p>

  <p>
    In parallel with my research, I have developed <strong>voltage control algorithms</strong> in VASP for electrochemical simulations, calculated <strong>grand canonical energies</strong> for CO₂ reduction, and identified new mechanisms such as <strong>proton shuttling</strong>. My work contributes to understanding and improving the efficiency of <strong>catalytic reactions for sustainable energy applications</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I have collaborated with the Department of Statistics to build <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong> that extract critical features from complex materials datasets, helping accelerate simulation workflows and improve decision-making in <strong>research and development environments</strong>.
  </p>

<p>
  Beyond individual research contributions, I have created three scientific software libraries: 
  <strong>one for designing and modeling advanced materials systems</strong>, 
  <strong>one for simulating and analyzing electrochemical processes</strong>, and 
  <strong>one for rendering and visualizing 3D simulated data as high-quality 2D images suitable for publications</strong>. 
  Since I am <strong>committed to building reusable, scalable infrastructure for computational science</strong>, 
  I developed these tools to support <strong>advanced research and accelerate discovery</strong> across disciplines.
</p>

  <p>
    My technical toolkit spans <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>Julia</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, and <strong>HPC environments</strong>, and includes deep experience with <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, <strong>PyTorch</strong>, <strong>VASP</strong>, and <strong>custom scientific software libraries</strong>. I bring a multifaceted skill set to every project, combining <strong>computational physics</strong>, <strong>advanced modeling</strong>, <strong>data engineering</strong>, and <strong>AI</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hold a <strong>master's degree in physics</strong> from the <strong>National and Kapodistrian University of Athens</strong>, where I applied deep learning techniques to problems in <strong>particle physics</strong>, including <strong>supersymmetry</strong> and <strong>dark matter detection</strong>. I have also served as a <strong>teaching assistant</strong> in both undergraduate and graduate courses, helping students explore the intersection of physics, computation, and data science.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you're building advanced simulation tools, developing ML models for materials discovery, or optimizing scientific software pipelines, I’m ready to collaborate and help move your technology forward.

                          I developed a <strong>data processing and visualization framework</strong> to evaluate <strong>machine learning models</strong> against <strong>rigorous simulations</strong>. In <strong>ASML’s workflow</strong> the optimizer does not see the validation data during training, most likely because of <strong>computational cost</strong> and <strong>efficiency constraints</strong>, since validating at every training step would significantly increase runtime and memory usage. As a result, an independent framework to evaluate model performance was needed. I designed pipelines that load intermediate <strong>model checkpoint results</strong> (modelchk_*, saved every few thousand steps) together with a <strong>rigorous reference</strong> (rigAI), align them by gauge, apply <strong>scenario-specific filters</strong> depending on whether the simulation is <strong>EUV</strong> or <strong>DUV</strong>, and compute physically meaningful error metrics. A key metric is the <strong>RMSE of the aerial image</strong>, which directly reflects optical model fidelity and is sensitive to <strong>overfitting</strong>, since a model that memorizes training data fails to generalize across slits, groups, and queueTags and therefore exhibits elevated validation RMSE. The pipelines separate training and validation data, compute <strong>aerial image RMSE</strong> and <strong>Model_CD RMSE</strong> across slits, groups, and queueTags, and aggregate the results into compact summary tables. For any set S of samples and a column c, the RMSE is defined as <em>RMSE<sub>c</sub> = sqrt((1/|S|) Σ<sub>i∈S</sub> (ML<sub>c,i</sub> − Rig<sub>c,i</sub>)²)</em>, which quantifies the deviation of the machine learning model from the rigorous reference in a physically interpretable way. I designed the framework with a <strong>two-layer parallelization approach</strong>. For a single simulation path, where the code must access and process many intermediate models saved at different steps, I used <strong>ThreadPoolExecutor</strong>, which was ideal for <strong>I/O-bound operations</strong> because multithreading allowed overlapping of frequent read and merge tasks without waiting for each access to complete. For larger-scale processing across multiple categories such as per group, per slit, and per queueTag, I used <strong>ProcessPoolExecutor</strong>, which is suited for <strong>CPU-intensive computations</strong> on large DataFrames and ensures that each CPU core works independently without being constrained by Python’s <strong>Global Interpreter Lock</strong>. By separating I/O-heavy and CPU-heavy tasks into different execution layers, the framework achieved both speed and stability, whereas alternative designs led to resource contention and bottlenecks. I also implemented <strong>Python code</strong> to export structured <strong>CSV results</strong> and generate <strong>high-resolution plots</strong>. These plots visualize <strong>training and validation loss curves</strong>, making it straightforward to identify cases of <strong>overfitting</strong> or <strong>underfitting</strong>. By combining automated data handling with precise statistical computations, I reduced manual effort, improved reproducibility, and delivered a framework that was later adopted by my team for <strong>large-scale simulation and machine learning experiments</strong>.

                           I developed a <strong>deep learning framework</strong> to evaluate the similarity of <strong>lithography simulation images</strong> using <strong>triplet learning</strong>. The method is based on training a <strong>convolutional neural network (ResNet18)</strong> to project images into a compact embedding space where structurally similar patterns are mapped close together while dissimilar patterns are pushed apart. I applied preprocessing transformations such as <strong>resizing</strong>, <strong>grayscale conversion</strong>, <strong>normalization</strong>, and <strong>tensor conversion</strong> to ensure consistent input representation. To improve training efficiency, I generated <strong>hard triplets</strong>, where the anchor and positive samples come from the same pattern group and the negative sample is deliberately chosen from a visually similar but different group, forcing the network to learn subtle discriminative features. <strong>Cosine similarity</strong> was used in the embedding space because it captures structural similarity independent of intensity scaling, which is particularly important in lithography where pattern fidelity must be measured beyond raw pixel brightness. The framework automatically organizes simulation data into <strong>training and validation sets</strong>, applies <strong>early stopping</strong> during optimization, and extracts embeddings for each group of patterns. After training, I computed both <strong>pairwise</strong> and <strong>average cosine similarities</strong> between groups and exported the results into structured <strong>CSV files</strong> for further analysis. These embeddings can also be used for <strong>clustering</strong>, <strong>anomaly detection</strong>, and <strong>model validation</strong>, extending the framework beyond similarity measurement and enabling broader applications in <strong>ASML’s lithography workflows</strong>.

               </ul>
   
              
                           
                <ul>
                   <li> <p>I worked with the <strong>Tachyon software</strong> and studied <strong>geometrical corner rounding</strong>. I personally designed <strong>FEM+ simulations</strong> and calculated the total run time, memory usage, and grid dependence. By performing a runtime breakdown, I was able to calculate the corner rounding run time, the render area and render edge time, as well as the EM3D time. For the contour-to-contour difference, I designed <strong>LMC+ simulations</strong> and used the <strong>MPC</strong> layer as the golden rule for my comparison. After discussing the results with <strong>R&D</strong>, this update was included in the latest Tachyon release and introduced to one of our biggest customers. I found that by using an updated geometrical corner rounding value, we could reduce significantly the computational time and corresponding memory usage by. I wrote my own Python and C++ code to extract data from large datasets, transformed them into libraries, and shared them with the company, where they were adopted by the product engineering group. Additionally, I <strong>identified</strong> a <strong>bug</strong> in the <strong>Tachyon software</strong> that was causing asymmetric jogs after applying the geometrical corner rounding algorithm. I proposed a solution to the research and development team, which they subsequently adopted.</p> </ul> 
                
                   <ul>
                  <li> <p>I worked on <strong>transition cross coefficient (TCC)</strong> optimization. I designed <strong>rigorous M3D simulations</strong> using <strong>Tachyon software</strong>, specifically <strong>FEM+</strong>. I utilized a variety of settings to calculate the optimal TCC number that yields the lowest aerial image critical dimension (AI_CD) difference between the baseline model and models with fewer TCC numbers. For this purpose, I used different settings and mask types, such as <strong>high numerical aperture with a low refraction index mask</strong>, <strong>high numerical aperture with a binary mask</strong> (with a large refractive index contrast, making the brighter side brighter and the dark side darker), <strong>low numerical aperture with a low refraction index</strong>, and <strong>low numerical aperture with a binary mask</strong>, each with different mask patterns. These patterns included <strong>one-dimensional patterns</strong>, <strong>two-dimensional patterns</strong>, <strong>circular patterns</strong>, <strong>elliptical patterns</strong>, and <strong>polygonal patterns</strong>. I calculated the optimal TCC number, which reduced significantly the runtime and the corresponding memory usage, while maintaining accuracy in the aerial image within a specification of 0.1 nm and causing a shift in the x and y directions of less than 0.01 nm. After discussing the results with the research and development team, we <strong>included this update in the next Tachyon software release</strong>, and the result was also adopted by our customer. Additionally, I wrote my own Python and C++ code to extract and process data from the simulations, using a completely different approach from my previous project. I developed custom scripts to automate the data extraction, filtering, and analysis processes, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets.</p>
                </ul> 

                </p>
                <ul>
                <li> <p>I also enhanced the <strong>API</strong> library we use for <strong>Tachyon software</strong>, based on <strong>ASML</strong> standards. I located and <strong>fixed</strong> several <strong>bugs</strong>, and <strong>updated</strong> the <strong>library</strong> with new <strong>functionalities</strong> that can be used to build simulations faster and obtain results more quickly. These improvements significantly <strong>enhanced performance</strong> and reliability for FEM+ applications. With dedication and attention to detail, I ensured that the <strong>API</strong> library is now <strong>more robust</strong> and efficient, supporting our team's ability to deliver high-quality simulations.</p>

  <li>This project addresses a fundamental challenge in semiconductor fabrication, which is <b>understanding and predicting the behavior of metal deposition on semiconductor surfaces</b>. Specifically, I examined the <b>epitaxial growth of lead (Pb) on the germanium (Ge(111)) surface</b>, an important process for creating <b>reliable electronic contacts in integrated circuits</b>. My goal was to determine the <b>critical coverage at which Pb begins to form crystalline islands</b>, a key factor that influences device performance and reliability.

I began by conducting <b>Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations</b>, enhanced using the <b>DFT+U+J method</b> to address the limitations of standard approximations in reproducing the electronic structure of Ge. By tuning the <b>Hubbard U and exchange J parameters</b>, I achieved an <b>accurate band gap of 0.67 eV for Ge</b>, closely matching experimental values. These high-precision simulations allowed me to calculate the <b>chemical potential of Pb across a range of coverages</b>. The results showed a clear threshold at <b>1.33 monolayers (ML)</b>, where the system energetically favors <b>island formation over uniform film growth</b>, marking the <b>onset of nucleation</b>.

To extend these findings to <b>realistic, large-scale systems</b> where DFT becomes computationally expensive, I developed a <b>two-stage machine learning framework</b>. In the first stage, I trained a <b>neural network model</b> to <b>predict atomic charges</b> using data from <b>10,000 relaxed atomic configurations</b>. Each configuration, containing 50 Ge and 10 Pb atoms, was represented using a <b>characteristic matrix capturing spatial coordinates, atomic types, and local atomic environments</b>. This model achieved <b>strong generalization performance</b> with a <b>mean squared error (MSE) of 0.51</b> on the test set.

In the second stage, I trained another <b>neural network model</b> to <b>predict system energies</b> using the charges predicted by the first model. I processed the inputs into a <b>compact vector format</b> and trained the network using cross-validation. The <b>best model architecture</b> featured <b>layers of 128 and 64 neurons, with dropout to prevent overfitting</b>, and achieved an <b>MSE of 0.41 on unseen data</b>. To scale the predictions to larger systems, I implemented a <b>sliding window approach</b> that enabled <b>localized predictions</b> while preserving the <b>integrity of the full system’s structure</b>.

The results from my machine learning models closely aligned with the <b>DFT simulations and experimental observations</b>, particularly in identifying the <b>nucleation threshold at 1.33 ML</b>. Notably, the <b>chemical potential curves</b> produced by the ML models were <b>smooth and consistent</b>, further confirming the <b>validity of the approach</b>. This strong agreement demonstrated that <b>machine learning can serve as a computationally efficient surrogate</b> for traditional quantum simulations when modeling large systems.

Overall, I developed a <b>scalable and accurate methodology for predicting nucleation phenomena</b> in metal-semiconductor systems. This is particularly relevant to the semiconductor industry, where <b>alloys are increasingly used due to their enhanced performance</b>. Since <b>alloys often lack periodic boundaries</b>, conventional simulations often fall short. By combining <b>DFT with machine learning</b>, I created a <b>powerful tool for predicting optimal deposition conditions</b>, potentially accelerating the <b>design of next-generation semiconductor devices</b>. This accomplishment played a <b>pivotal role in securing NSF funding</b>.

</ul>
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>

  <li>In this project, I aimed to <b>predict the structural image of a metal (Pb) deposited on a semiconductor (Ge) surface</b>, effectively <b>visualizing the output of the deposition simulation</b>. This was a <b>complex task involving spatial data</b>, which is well-suited for <b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</b> due to their strength in detecting spatial features and patterns in grid-like data. CNNs allow for the learning of <b>hierarchical representations</b>, making them ideal for modeling the formation of atomic structures in three-dimensional space.

I utilized <b>10,000 previously relaxed configurations</b>, each containing 60 atoms (50 Ge and 10 Pb). I embedded each configuration within a <b>three-dimensional 10×10×10 voxel grid</b> to spatially map atom positions and features. This resulted in a <b>volumetric data structure</b> representing the system, where each voxel stores <b>six channels of information</b>: atom type (one-hot encoded into four channels), <b>atomic charge (normalized)</b>, and <b>electrostatic potential (standardized)</b>. I organized the data into <b>tensors of shape 10×10×10×6</b> to serve as model inputs, while the <b>target output</b> for each sample was a <b>60×3 matrix</b> representing the <b>relaxed (x, y, z) positions of all atoms</b>.

To develop a predictive model, I applied <b>extensive hyperparameter tuning and training optimization</b>. I explored different CNN architectures, testing 2 to 4 convolutional layers with <b>filter sizes ranging from 16 to 128</b> and <b>kernel sizes of 3×3×3 and 5×5×5</b>. I used pooling strategies (max and average pooling), <b>batch normalization</b>, and <b>dropout</b> to improve generalization and stabilize training. After feature extraction, I added one or two <b>dense layers for final regression</b>. I evaluated optimizers including <b>Adam, RMSprop, and SGD</b>, along with <b>learning rate schedules</b> and various batch sizes. I normalized the <b>input features</b> while keeping atomic positions unscaled. I split the dataset into <b>80% training and 20% validation</b>, using <b>early stopping and learning rate adjustments</b> to prevent overfitting and improve convergence.

My <b>best-performing model</b> began with a <b>10×10×10×6 input tensor</b> and passed it through <b>two 3D convolutional layers</b> with 32 and 64 filters, respectively, each using a <b>3×3×3 kernel</b>. I applied <b>batch normalization and max pooling</b> after each convolution to downsample and regularize the learning process. The output was then <b>flattened</b> and passed through a <b>dense hidden layer with 64 neurons and dropout (0.2–0.3)</b>, followed by a final dense layer that output the <b>predicted (x, y, z) positions of each atom</b>. This model achieved the <b>lowest validation loss</b> using the <b>Adam optimizer (learning rate ≈ 10⁻³)</b>, confirming its <b>strong generalization performance</b>.

To prepare <b>large systems for prediction</b>, I treated each Ge atom as a reference point and voxelized the surrounding space into a <b>10×10×10 grid</b>. I collected features from nearby 49 Ge and 10 Pb atoms and encoded them into a <b>1000×6 matrix</b>, which I reshaped into a <b>4D input tensor</b>. I repeated this process for all atoms, generating a <b>dynamic tensor</b> to be fed into the CNN. I calculated the <b>final prediction for each atom’s position</b> by <b>averaging its predicted coordinates across all voxel windows</b> in which it appeared.

After generating the <b>predicted atomic positions</b>, I compared them with those obtained from <b>DFT relaxation</b>. The resulting <b>deposition images</b> from both methods showed <b>strong visual and structural agreement</b>, confirming the CNN’s <b>ability to accurately reproduce the relaxed atomic arrangements</b>. Notably, this <b>predictive capability scaled to much larger systems</b>, where traditional simulations become computationally prohibitive.

In conclusion, by <b>integrating a Convolutional Neural Network into my modeling workflow</b>, I developed a <b>highly effective method for predicting the final deposition pattern</b> of metals on semiconductor surfaces. My model <b>captured the complex spatial relationships and physical interactions</b> within the system, offering a <b>fast, scalable, and physically grounded alternative</b> to conventional relaxation methods for <b>large-scale atomic systems</b>. <b>This model significantly accelerated computational calculations, reducing the need for time-consuming simulations. Instead, it produced highly accurate results by multiplying the model’s learned weights with the input tensors, effectively reconstructing the atomic positions. These predicted coordinates were then used to generate morphology images that closely resembled those obtained from traditional DFT-based relaxation</b>.

I initiated a collaboration between the Department of Physics and the Department of Statistics and <strong>led the development of a machine learning methodology to improve node classification on incomplete graph datasets</strong>. The core challenge I addressed was <strong>how to maintain high prediction accuracy when parts of the data, specifically nodes, are missing</strong>. I set out to understand how different node removal strategies impact model performance, and how combining results from multiple models could enhance generalization across sparsely observed graphs. To tackle this, <strong>I used Simplified Graph Convolutional Networks (SGC)</strong>, a lightweight and efficient alternative to traditional GCNs. SGC collapses multiple layers into a single propagation step and removes non-linearities, which <strong>allowed me to significantly reduce training time without sacrificing model accuracy</strong>. I implemented the entire pipeline from scratch in <strong>Julia</strong>, using the <strong>Flux ML library</strong>. <strong>I designed and engineered three custom graph reduction techniques</strong>: truncating the last <em>n</em> nodes, randomly removing a percentage of nodes, and eliminating a contiguous block of nodes. After each reduction, <strong>I recalculated the normalized adjacency matrix (S matrix)</strong> by incorporating self-loops and applying degree normalization, raising the result to the power of three to enable higher-order propagation. I trained the models using a <strong>one-shot learning approach</strong>, running a single forward pass on each reduced graph, followed by a simple single-layer neural network trained with <strong>cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer</strong>. To evaluate the model's effectiveness, I split the data into 60% training and 40% testing sets, and compared predicted vs. true labels using one-hot encodings. I carefully monitored accuracy on both reduced and full graphs. <strong>Notably, I introduced a parameter averaging strategy to further boost performance</strong>: by training separate models on slightly different graph reductions and averaging their learned weight matrices, <strong>I was able to significantly improve results</strong> when the final model was applied back to the full dataset. This approach consistently led to improved accuracy, <strong>rising from around 91% to as high as 94%</strong>, particularly when the node removal followed a structured, rather than random, pattern. I validated the method not only on the <strong>Cora citation dataset</strong>, but also on <strong>synthetic graphs generated using the Barabási–Albert model</strong>, which mimics the scale-free structure of many real-world networks. <strong>The pipeline scaled effectively</strong>, showing that this methodology can generalize well to unseen or non-periodic graphs. <strong>Overall, this project combined theoretical insights, practical engineering, and rigorous experimentation</strong> to address a real-world challenge in graph-based machine learning. <strong>It was a rewarding opportunity to lead a technically deep initiative</strong> and contribute to interdisciplinary research at the intersection of physics, statistics, network science, and neural networks.

  <li><b>I introduced a novel method to model the electrolyte at the electrochemical interface using ab initio simulations of charge transfer processes at surfaces.</b> I presented a simple capacitor model of the interface that addresses key challenges, including: i) the requirement for large cell heights to achieve convergence, <b>which incurs significant computational costs</b>, and ii) the costly iterative calculations of reaction energetics needed to tune the surface charge to the desired potential. 

  I derived a correction to the energy for finite cell heights, enabling the calculation of large cell energies without additional computational expense. Furthermore, I demonstrated that reaction energetics determined at constant charge can be easily mapped to those at constant potential, eliminating the need for iterative schemes to tune the system to a constant potential.

  <li> In my recent research, I explored the <b>Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)</b>, a <b>key process in water splitting and clean energy conversion</b>. HER can proceed through different mechanisms depending on the electrolyte’s pH, but under neutral conditions, the <b>Volmer step</b>, where a <b>hydrogen atom adsorbs onto the electrode surface</b>, is the <b>rate-limiting step</b>. Because of this, my work specifically focuses on <b>understanding and improving this critical part of the reaction</b>.

In a <b>joint experimental and computational study</b>, I discovered that <b>non-metallic cations</b>, particularly <b>ammonium (NH₄⁺)</b> and <b>methylammonium (CH₃NH₃⁺)</b>, <b>significantly enhance HER activity</b> on a <b>gold (Au(111)) surface</b> compared to the <b>metallic sodium ion (Na⁺)</b>. These findings raised an important question: <b>what makes non-metallic cations more effective at promoting HER?</b>

To answer this, I employed <b>Grand Canonical Density Functional Theory (GC-DFT)</b>, using the <b>TPOT package</b> in conjunction with <b>VASP and VASPsol</b>. This method allows the <b>number of electrons to adjust dynamically</b> during the simulation to maintain a <b>constant electrode potential</b>. I also used a <b>realistic solvent model</b> with <b>40 water molecules</b> and a <b>4×4×5 Au(111) slab</b> to simulate the electrolyte environment, and applied a <b>slow-growth approach</b> to calculate the <b>activation barriers</b> of the reaction.

Through these simulations, I found that <b>hydrogen can adsorb on the electrode surface via two general pathways</b>: from the <b>dissociation of water molecules within the cation’s hydration shell</b> or from <b>bulk water outside of it</b>. However, in systems with <b>non-metallic cations</b>, I identified <b>two additional mechanisms</b>: <b>direct cation splitting</b> and <b>proton shuttling</b>. These <b>unique pathways lower the energy barrier</b> for hydrogen adsorption, helping to <b>accelerate the HER</b>.

Overall, my results show that the <b>identity of the cation plays a critical role</b> in the <b>HER mechanism and efficiency</b>. <b>Non-metallic cations like NH₄⁺ and CH₃NH₃⁺</b> not only <b>lower activation barriers</b>, but also <b>introduce new proton transfer routes</b> not available with traditional metal cations. This insight could <b>open up new directions for catalyst design</b> in <b>future energy technologies</b>.

This project investigates key challenges in sustainable electrochemistry, focusing on how electrolyte composition, particularly the nature of cations, influences the electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO₂RR). My work centered on <strong>Bi(111)</strong>, a promising catalyst for CO₂ conversion, and how <strong>non-metal cations affect CO₂ adsorption and product formation</strong>. The aim was to understand the mechanistic role of these cations and determine how they modulate binding energies, activation barriers, and reaction pathways that govern the generation of <strong>CO and formate</strong>.

To pursue this, I designed and conducted a series of high-fidelity simulations using <strong>grand canonical density functional theory (GC-DFT)</strong>. I employed the TPOT package alongside VASP and VASPSol, which allowed me to maintain fixed electrode potentials by dynamically optimizing the system's electron count. This method was essential for accurately capturing the electrochemical environment and isolating potential-dependent phenomena in a controlled and reproducible manner.

I systematically explored a range of non-metallic cations—<strong>NH₄⁺, CH₃NH₃⁺, and (CH₃)₄N⁺</strong>—and benchmarked them against a conventional metallic cation, <strong>Na⁺</strong>. Through detailed GC-DFT calculations, I evaluated CO₂ binding energies and found that <strong>non-metal cations significantly enhanced CO₂ adsorption</strong> by up to 0.2 eV compared to Na⁺. This enhancement was attributed to <strong>stronger electrostatic interactions and more favorable charge transfer</strong> characteristics at the Bi–CO₂ interface.

In addition, I mapped the full reaction landscape for CO₂ reduction, from initial adsorption to the formation of <strong>CO and HCOO⁻</strong>. The study revealed that formate can be produced via two distinct pathways—direct hydrogenation of solvated CO₂, or surface adsorption followed by hydrogenation. The former pathway emerged as <strong>energetically preferred and largely independent of the cation</strong>, while <strong>CO formation was more sensitive to cation identity and hydration dynamics</strong>.

To explore the role of water and proton availability, I carried out <strong>nudged elastic band (NEB) calculations</strong> for water dissociation and hydrogen shuttling, revealing <strong>activation barriers of 1.10–1.12 eV</strong> for Na⁺ and NH₄⁺. These steps are critical in delivering reactive hydrogen species to CO₂, enabling the formation of intermediates such as COOH* and ultimately CO. The results showed that <strong>NH₄⁺ uniquely stabilizes these intermediates</strong> through hydrogen bonding, which contributes to lower desorption barriers and improved CO₂RR activity.

This work presents a <strong>comprehensive model of how non-metal cations interact with both the electrode and reaction intermediates</strong>. The study demonstrated that <strong>non-metal cations often outperform metal cations</strong> by enhancing CO₂ adsorption and improving the energetics of downstream transformations. These insights offer practical guidance for the <strong>design of next-generation electrolytes and catalytic interfaces</strong> aimed at carbon-neutral fuel synthesis.

Overall, this research illustrates how <strong>grand canonical DFT, combined with mechanistic insight and electrochemical understanding</strong>, can bridge the gap between atomic-scale theory and experimentally observable behavior. The findings have supported key experimental collaborations and helped secure <strong>Department of Energy funding</strong>, while laying a strong foundation for <strong>future data-driven modeling of electrochemical interfaces</strong>.

  My findings revealed that, except for slightly modified binding energies and shifted orbital levels, the choice of the underlying substrate layer had little effect on the electronic structure. Additionally, I observed a prominent unoccupied ligand-to-metal charge transfer state in [CoIII(SQ)(Cat)(3-tpp)2] ↔ [CoII(SQ)2(3-tpp)2], which remained virtually insensitive to the interface between the polymer and tautomeric complexes in the Co(II) high-spin state.

This thesis develops a unified computational framework that integrates <strong>first-principles modeling</strong> with <strong>machine learning</strong> to address complex, multi-scale problems in <strong>energy conversion</strong>, <strong>materials growth</strong>, and <strong>graph-structured data</strong>. A central challenge across these domains is to extract reliable predictions from <strong>incomplete or computationally intensive datasets</strong> and apply them to <strong>larger, realistic systems</strong>. The research focuses on combining physical insight with scalable learning architectures to model atomic-level interactions, thin film growth, and data-limited environments.
</p>

<p>
The work begins with an investigation into <strong>thin film nucleation in metal-semiconductor systems</strong>, specifically the epitaxial growth of <strong>Pb on Ge(111)</strong>. High-accuracy <strong>DFT+U+J</strong> calculations revealed a critical nucleation threshold at <strong>1.33 monolayers</strong>, beyond which island formation becomes energetically favorable. To extend this understanding to non-periodic, large-scale systems, a <strong>two-stage machine learning surrogate model</strong> was developed. One neural network predicted <strong>atomic charges</strong>, while another estimated <strong>total system energies</strong>, achieving results consistent with DFT and enabling efficient exploration of alloy deposition conditions.
</p>

<p>
To visualize the structural outcomes of deposition, a <strong>3D convolutional neural network (CNN)</strong> was constructed to predict relaxed atomic positions from initial configurations. Using <strong>voxelized tensors</strong> encoding atom types, charges, and electrostatic potentials, the CNN learned spatial relationships governing final morphology. The model generated atomistic structures nearly indistinguishable from DFT-relaxed geometries, offering a <strong>fast, scalable alternative</strong> for simulating complex deposition processes.
</p>

<p>
Following this, the thesis explores how data from <strong>first-principles simulations</strong> can be further abstracted into <strong>graph representations</strong> to enable analysis under <strong>sparse conditions</strong>. In collaboration with the Departments of Physics and Statistics, a methodology was developed to encode atomic configurations or simulation domains as <strong>graphs</strong>, allowing truncated or reduced-node simulations. Using <strong>Simplified Graph Convolutional Networks (SGCs)</strong> implemented in Julia, the project introduced three node-reduction strategies and a <strong>parameter averaging technique</strong> to enhance robustness across sparsely observed graphs. Applied back to the full systems, this ensemble approach increased node classification accuracy from <strong>91% to 94%</strong>. Validated on the <strong>Cora citation network</strong> and <strong>Barabási–Albert synthetic graphs</strong>, the method demonstrated strong generalization performance and parallels the scalability challenges encountered in quantum modeling.
</p>

<p>
The final section turns to <strong>sustainable electrochemical systems</strong>, focusing on the <strong>CO₂ reduction reaction (CO₂RR)</strong> and <strong>hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)</strong>. To simulate these reactions under constant electrode potential, two key tools were developed: a hybrid solvation model (<strong>SOLHYBRID</strong>) and a potential control algorithm (<strong>TPOT</strong>). These enabled <strong>grand-canonical DFT</strong> and <strong>AIMD</strong> simulations that uncovered how <strong>non-metallic ammonium cations</strong> like <strong>CH₃NH₃⁺</strong> enhance CO₂ adsorption and reduce the activation barrier for <strong>H* formation</strong> on <strong>bismuth electrodes</strong>. Experimental validation using <strong>H-cell</strong> and <strong>gas-diffusion electrodes (GDEs)</strong> confirmed that CH₃NH₃⁺ achieves <strong>nearly double the current density</strong> compared to Na⁺.
</p>

<p>
Simulations of <strong>HER on Au(111)</strong> surfaces revealed novel <strong>cation-mediated mechanisms</strong>, including <strong>proton shuttling</strong> and <strong>direct proton donation</strong>, that are inaccessible to traditional metallic cations. These pathways reduce energy barriers and establish ammonium-based species as <strong>active co-catalysts</strong> in electrochemical reactions.
</p>

<p>
Together, these studies demonstrate how <strong>machine learning can extend the reach of first-principles simulations</strong>, from predicting atomic configurations to learning from incomplete data. By unifying techniques across <strong>surface science</strong>, <strong>electrochemistry</strong>, and <strong>graph theory</strong>, this work provides scalable, physically grounded models that support the design of next-generation materials, interfaces, and sustainable energy technologies.

<p> For my master’s research, I integrated <b>deep learning methodologies to unravel the mysteries of supersymmetry and dark matter</b>. While the Standard Model is foundational to modern particle physics, it falls short in addressing the <b>hierarchy problem</b>—the disparity between electroweak and gravitational forces. <b>Supersymmetry</b>, a hypothetical extension of the Standard Model, offers a compelling solution to this problem. At the core of my research is the exploration of the <b>Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP)</b>, a theoretical entity with profound implications for <b>dark matter</b>.

<b>Employing advanced deep learning techniques</b>, I calculated the <b>cross-section for the scattering of dark matter particles from ordinary matter</b>, shedding light on the elusive nature of dark matter. My investigation spanned both <b>direct and indirect detection methods</b>, where I performed a thorough analysis of experimental setups and conducted <b>rigorous comparisons between theoretical predictions and astronomical observations</b>. Using <b>data science methodologies</b>, I validated the robustness of my model, ensuring it aligned with real-world data.

In the domain of <b>direct dark matter detection</b>, I <b>developed and trained a deep neural network</b> specifically designed to identify the <b>cross-section of dark matter particles</b>, using data collected from <b>Fermi-LAT</b>. The sophisticated structure and function of this <b>neural network</b> significantly improved the precision and reliability of insights into dark matter interactions.

My research also extended into <b>indirect detection methods</b>, including the study of <b>annihilated dark matter particles</b> and the detection of <b>neutrinos and photons</b>. In this context, I built and deployed another <b>neural network</b> that was instrumental in <b>confirming the exclusive origins of neutrinos from specific particle interactions</b>. These networks became central to my work, serving as <b>critical tools within a broader data science framework</b>, used to refine and test theoretical models against real-world cosmic data.

Ultimately, my work led to a <b>comprehensive understanding of the interplay between supersymmetry and dark matter</b>, with <b>data science emerging as the key enabler</b> in decoding these cosmic mysteries.</p>

                             My undergraduate thesis was grounded in a published research paper produced by a team of researchers, which I thoroughly studied, reproduced, and restructured into an original and comprehensive presentation. Building on that foundation, I conducted an in-depth investigation into the <b>decomposition reactions of the neutral pion (&pi;<sup>0</sup>)</b>, analyzing not only the different decay channels but also the <b>probabilities associated with each reaction pathway</b>. As part of my research, I undertook a detailed study of the <b>Tevatron accelerator</b> and its <b>trace detection systems</b>, including the <b>CDF (Collider Detector at Fermilab)</b>, <b>SVXII</b>, <b>ISL (Intermediate Silicon Layers)</b>, and <b>COT (Central Outer Tracker)</b>. These detectors are designed to trace the trajectories of charged particles, and I focused on their structure and operational dynamics. I also examined the <b>&gamma; &rarr; e<sup>-</sup> e<sup>+</sup></b> conversion process within the Tevatron, aiming to minimize uncertainty in the <b>initial conversion probability</b>. To accomplish this, I developed an <b>algorithm</b> that enabled the <b>reconstruction of the &pi;<sup>0</sup> mass</b> by combining four distinct particle trajectories. This reconstruction allowed me to determine the <b>cleavage position of the &pi;<sup>0</sup></b>. I further explored the feasibility of using <b>spatial variables</b> in analyzing &pi;<sup>0</sup> decay modes, including both <b>normal and Dalitz decays</b>, while deeply examining their <b>topologies</b>. Throughout this process, I identified and defined the most effective spatial variables, <b>firstpoint</b> and <b>minpoint</b>, as critical features in my analysis. Here, the <b>Monte Carlo technique</b> played a pivotal role in simulating and validating my results. Finally, using the resulting decay topology diagrams, I was able to <b>identify and distinguish the ISL, COT, and SVXII detectors</b>, effectively linking theory, simulation, and detector response.
