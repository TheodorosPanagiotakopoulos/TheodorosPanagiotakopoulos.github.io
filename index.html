                                    <li> <b> Introduced a second generation neural-network representation that is several orders of magnitude faster than Density Functional Theory (DFT)</b>. This method, relies on local properties and is not taking into account global changes in the electronic structure. This representation gives the energy and forces as a function of all atomic positions in systems of any size. An atomic neural network uses the local chemical environment to determine each atom’s energy. A feed-forward neural network, in which information only passes in one direction toward the output layer, is the sort of neural network that is used for fitting energy. There are two layers: an input layer that feeds the network with the respective atomic positions and an output layer that holds the atomic potential energy. The regression is carried out by a number of intermediary hidden layers, with the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer being empirically optimized for the particular application. </ul>

                                    <li> <b> Developed a general solution for the limitations of current machine learning potentials by introducing a fourth-generation Neural Network, which is applicable to long-range charge transfer and multiple charge states </b>. It consists of highly accurate short-range atomic energies similar to those used in second generation <b> neural networks</b> potentials and charges determined from a charge equilibration method relying on electronegativities. Both, the short-range atomic energies as well as the electronegativities are expressed by atomic <b> neural networks </b> as a function of the chemical environments. For all these systems we demonstrate that fourth generation <b>neural network </b> potentials trained to DFT data are able to provide reliable energies, forces and charges in excellent agreement with electronic structure calculations. We show that previous generations of <b> neural network </b> potentials, which are unable to take distant structural changes into account, yield inaccurate energies and forces, which are correctly resolved by this  <b> neural network </b> potential. These results apply to other types of machine learning potentials.</ul>

                                    <li> <b> Worked with the Department of Statistics in order to research is and investigate how graph convolutional neural networks can enhance the accuracy of predictions.The accuracy of predictions on a truncated dataset is examined in our experiments.</b> The prediction made by averaging the parameters of two truncated datasets is then analyzed to determine if performance improvement can be observed. This is done by applying the methodological framework of the Simplified <b>Graph Convolutional Neural Network(SGC)</b> to Cora dataset. The impact of node removal on prediction accuracy is investigated by selecting nodes with three distinct patterns. Insights gained from these experiments shed light on which node patterns are crucial for optimizing the performance of  <b>SGC</b>. If node removal is focused on a localized selection, the results demonstrate that SGC effectively utilizes the local information of network nodes. In this case, the applied method of improving the  <b>SGC’</b>s accuracy, has better performance compared to a case where the
nodes were randomly dropped. </ul>

We derived a correction to the energy for finite cell heights to obtain the large cell energies at no additional computational expense.

For Bi-catalyzed CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction Reaction ( CO<sub>2</sub> RR) that produces CO and formate, density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were performed to examine the effect of asymmetric cations (such as CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>  ) on CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and activation. </b> Experimental studies confirm that the asymmetric cations have a stronger promotional effect on the CO2RR activity than the symmetric ones, which is attributed to the asymmetric and weak hydration shell that stabilizes adsorbed CO<sub>2</sub> . Moreover, by comparing the cations with different sizes ( NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>  ,  Me<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup>  Et<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup>), we observed a notable effect of the cation size on CO production activity, with a negligible im- pact on formate production.

                           My master's integrates <b> deep learning methodologies to unravel the mysteries of supersymmetry and dark matter.</b> The Standard Model, foundational to modern particle physics, falls short in addressing the hierarchy problem—the disparity between electroweak and gravitational forces. Supersymmetry, a hypothetical extension of the Standard Model, emerges as a compelling solution to this conundrum. Central to my research is the exploration of the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP), a theoretical entity holding profound implications for dark matter.

<b> Employing advanced deep learning techniques,</b> I meticulously calculate the cross-section for the scattering of dark matter particles from ordinary matter, illuminating the elusive nature of dark matter. My investigation extends to both direct and indirect methods of dark matter detection, involving a thorough exploration of experimental setups and rigorous comparisons between theoretical predictions and observational astronomy data. Utilizing data science methodologies, I validate the robustness of the employed model, ensuring its alignment with real-world observations.

In the realm of direct dark matter detection, <b> I developed and trained a deep neural network </b> specifically designed to identify the cross-section of dark matter particles, utilizing collected data from Fermi-LAT. The intricate workings of this <b> neural network </b> enhance the precision and reliability of our understanding of dark matter interactions.

Moreover, my exploration extends to indirect methods of dark matter detection, including scenarios of annihilated dark matter particles and the observation of neutrinos and photons. In this context, another <b> neural network </b> I developed plays a crucial role, confirming the exclusive origins of neutrinos from specific particles. Throughout this scientific odyssey, these deep neural networks stand as pivotal tools within the overarching data science framework, refining and validating theoretical predictions against observational data from the vast expanse of the cosmos. My research thus culminates in a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between supersymmetry and dark matter, with data science emerging as the indispensable tool for unraveling these cosmic enigmas.

                            It was based on research paper that has been produced by other reinformation searchers. I had to study it, reproduce it and piece it an original presentation. According to my undergraduate thesis, reference is made not only to the decomposition reactions of &pi; <sup>0</sup>,  but also to the probability that occurs in each of them. A study is also made to a detailed analysis of the structure and mode of operation of the Tevatron accelerator and of the CDF (Collider Detector at Fermilab), SVXII, ISL (Silicon Layers) and COT (Central Outer Tracker) detectors, which are the trace detection systems and are designed to detect the charged particle trajectories. Next, the conversion of &gamma; &rarr; e <sup> - </sup> e<sup> + </sup> to Tevatron is studied to reduce the uncertainty in the initial conversion probability. The above procedure is done by creating an algorithm. From the reconstruction of the mass of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> and from the combination of the four trajectories, I find the cleavage position of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> . Then we analyze the possibility of using the space variables in the decomposition of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> while analyzing the topology of both normal and Daliz &pi; <sup> 0 </sup>. After the study we come to the selection of the appropriate variables which are defined as firstpoint and minpoint, where Monte Carlo technic plaid a crucial role. Finally, from the diagram that emerged from the breakpoints of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> , we proceeded to identify the ISL, COT and SVXII detectors.
