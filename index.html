                   <li> <p>I worked with the <strong>Tachyon software</strong> and studied <strong>geometrical corner rounding</strong>. I personally designed <strong>FEM+ simulations</strong> and calculated the total run time, memory usage, and grid dependence. By performing a runtime breakdown, I was able to calculate the corner rounding run time, the render area and render edge time, as well as the EM3D time. For the contour-to-contour difference, I designed <strong>LMC+ simulations</strong> and used the <strong>MPC</strong> layer as the golden rule for my comparison. After discussing the results with <strong>R&D</strong>, this update was included in the latest Tachyon release and introduced to one of our biggest customers. I found that by using an updated geometrical corner rounding value, we could reduce significantly the computational time and corresponding memory usage by. I wrote my own Python and C++ code to extract data from large datasets, transformed them into libraries, and shared them with the company, where they were adopted by the product engineering group. Additionally, I <strong>identified</strong> a <strong>bug</strong> in the <strong>Tachyon software</strong> that was causing asymmetric jogs after applying the geometrical corner rounding algorithm. I proposed a solution to the research and development team, which they subsequently adopted.</p> </ul> 
                
                   <ul>
                  <li> <p>I worked on <strong>transition cross coefficient (TCC)</strong> optimization. I designed <strong>rigorous M3D simulations</strong> using <strong>Tachyon software</strong>, specifically <strong>FEM+</strong>. I utilized a variety of settings to calculate the optimal TCC number that yields the lowest aerial image critical dimension (AI_CD) difference between the baseline model and models with fewer TCC numbers. For this purpose, I used different settings and mask types, such as <strong>high numerical aperture with a low refraction index mask</strong>, <strong>high numerical aperture with a binary mask</strong> (with a large refractive index contrast, making the brighter side brighter and the dark side darker), <strong>low numerical aperture with a low refraction index</strong>, and <strong>low numerical aperture with a binary mask</strong>, each with different mask patterns. These patterns included <strong>one-dimensional patterns</strong>, <strong>two-dimensional patterns</strong>, <strong>circular patterns</strong>, <strong>elliptical patterns</strong>, and <strong>polygonal patterns</strong>. I calculated the optimal TCC number, which reduced significantly the runtime and the corresponding memory usage, while maintaining accuracy in the aerial image within a specification of 0.1 nm and causing a shift in the x and y directions of less than 0.01 nm. After discussing the results with the research and development team, we <strong>included this update in the next Tachyon software release</strong>, and the result was also adopted by our customer. Additionally, I wrote my own Python and C++ code to extract and process data from the simulations, using a completely different approach from my previous project. I developed custom scripts to automate the data extraction, filtering, and analysis processes, allowing for efficient handling of large datasets.</p>
                </ul> 

                </p>
                <ul>
                <li> <p>I also enhanced the <strong>API</strong> library we use for <strong>Tachyon software</strong>, based on <strong>ASML</strong> standards. I located and <strong>fixed</strong> several <strong>bugs</strong>, and <strong>updated</strong> the <strong>library</strong> with new <strong>functionalities</strong> that can be used to build simulations faster and obtain results more quickly. These improvements significantly <strong>enhanced performance</strong> and reliability for FEM+ applications. With dedication and attention to detail, I ensured that the <strong>API</strong> library is now <strong>more robust</strong> and efficient, supporting our team's ability to deliver high-quality simulations.</p>

  <li>This project addresses a fundamental challenge in semiconductor fabrication, which is <b>understanding and predicting the behavior of metal deposition on semiconductor surfaces</b>. Specifically, I examined the <b>epitaxial growth of lead (Pb) on the germanium (Ge(111)) surface</b>, an important process for creating <b>reliable electronic contacts in integrated circuits</b>. My goal was to determine the <b>critical coverage at which Pb begins to form crystalline islands</b>, a key factor that influences device performance and reliability.

I began by conducting <b>Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations</b>, enhanced using the <b>DFT+U+J method</b> to address the limitations of standard approximations in reproducing the electronic structure of Ge. By tuning the <b>Hubbard U and exchange J parameters</b>, I achieved an <b>accurate band gap of 0.67 eV for Ge</b>, closely matching experimental values. These high-precision simulations allowed me to calculate the <b>chemical potential of Pb across a range of coverages</b>. The results showed a clear threshold at <b>1.33 monolayers (ML)</b>, where the system energetically favors <b>island formation over uniform film growth</b>, marking the <b>onset of nucleation</b>.

To extend these findings to <b>realistic, large-scale systems</b> where DFT becomes computationally expensive, I developed a <b>two-stage machine learning framework</b>. In the first stage, I trained a <b>neural network model</b> to <b>predict atomic charges</b> using data from <b>10,000 relaxed atomic configurations</b>. Each configuration, containing 50 Ge and 10 Pb atoms, was represented using a <b>characteristic matrix capturing spatial coordinates, atomic types, and local atomic environments</b>. This model achieved <b>strong generalization performance</b> with a <b>mean squared error (MSE) of 0.51</b> on the test set.

In the second stage, I trained another <b>neural network model</b> to <b>predict system energies</b> using the charges predicted by the first model. I processed the inputs into a <b>compact vector format</b> and trained the network using cross-validation. The <b>best model architecture</b> featured <b>layers of 128 and 64 neurons, with dropout to prevent overfitting</b>, and achieved an <b>MSE of 0.41 on unseen data</b>. To scale the predictions to larger systems, I implemented a <b>sliding window approach</b> that enabled <b>localized predictions</b> while preserving the <b>integrity of the full system’s structure</b>.

The results from my machine learning models closely aligned with the <b>DFT simulations and experimental observations</b>, particularly in identifying the <b>nucleation threshold at 1.33 ML</b>. Notably, the <b>chemical potential curves</b> produced by the ML models were <b>smooth and consistent</b>, further confirming the <b>validity of the approach</b>. This strong agreement demonstrated that <b>machine learning can serve as a computationally efficient surrogate</b> for traditional quantum simulations when modeling large systems.

Overall, I developed a <b>scalable and accurate methodology for predicting nucleation phenomena</b> in metal-semiconductor systems. This is particularly relevant to the semiconductor industry, where <b>alloys are increasingly used due to their enhanced performance</b>. Since <b>alloys often lack periodic boundaries</b>, conventional simulations often fall short. By combining <b>DFT with machine learning</b>, I created a <b>powerful tool for predicting optimal deposition conditions</b>, potentially accelerating the <b>design of next-generation semiconductor devices</b>. This accomplishment played a <b>pivotal role in securing NSF funding</b>.

</ul>
                                    
                                    
                                    <p>

  <li>In this project, I aimed to <b>predict the structural image of a metal (Pb) deposited on a semiconductor (Ge) surface</b>, effectively <b>visualizing the output of the deposition simulation</b>. This was a <b>complex task involving spatial data</b>, which is well-suited for <b>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</b> due to their strength in detecting spatial features and patterns in grid-like data. CNNs allow for the learning of <b>hierarchical representations</b>, making them ideal for modeling the formation of atomic structures in three-dimensional space.

I utilized <b>10,000 previously relaxed configurations</b>, each containing 60 atoms (50 Ge and 10 Pb). I embedded each configuration within a <b>three-dimensional 10×10×10 voxel grid</b> to spatially map atom positions and features. This resulted in a <b>volumetric data structure</b> representing the system, where each voxel stores <b>six channels of information</b>: atom type (one-hot encoded into four channels), <b>atomic charge (normalized)</b>, and <b>electrostatic potential (standardized)</b>. I organized the data into <b>tensors of shape 10×10×10×6</b> to serve as model inputs, while the <b>target output</b> for each sample was a <b>60×3 matrix</b> representing the <b>relaxed (x, y, z) positions of all atoms</b>.

To develop a predictive model, I applied <b>extensive hyperparameter tuning and training optimization</b>. I explored different CNN architectures, testing 2 to 4 convolutional layers with <b>filter sizes ranging from 16 to 128</b> and <b>kernel sizes of 3×3×3 and 5×5×5</b>. I used pooling strategies (max and average pooling), <b>batch normalization</b>, and <b>dropout</b> to improve generalization and stabilize training. After feature extraction, I added one or two <b>dense layers for final regression</b>. I evaluated optimizers including <b>Adam, RMSprop, and SGD</b>, along with <b>learning rate schedules</b> and various batch sizes. I normalized the <b>input features</b> while keeping atomic positions unscaled. I split the dataset into <b>80% training and 20% validation</b>, using <b>early stopping and learning rate adjustments</b> to prevent overfitting and improve convergence.

My <b>best-performing model</b> began with a <b>10×10×10×6 input tensor</b> and passed it through <b>two 3D convolutional layers</b> with 32 and 64 filters, respectively, each using a <b>3×3×3 kernel</b>. I applied <b>batch normalization and max pooling</b> after each convolution to downsample and regularize the learning process. The output was then <b>flattened</b> and passed through a <b>dense hidden layer with 64 neurons and dropout (0.2–0.3)</b>, followed by a final dense layer that output the <b>predicted (x, y, z) positions of each atom</b>. This model achieved the <b>lowest validation loss</b> using the <b>Adam optimizer (learning rate ≈ 10⁻³)</b>, confirming its <b>strong generalization performance</b>.

To prepare <b>large systems for prediction</b>, I treated each Ge atom as a reference point and voxelized the surrounding space into a <b>10×10×10 grid</b>. I collected features from nearby 49 Ge and 10 Pb atoms and encoded them into a <b>1000×6 matrix</b>, which I reshaped into a <b>4D input tensor</b>. I repeated this process for all atoms, generating a <b>dynamic tensor</b> to be fed into the CNN. I calculated the <b>final prediction for each atom’s position</b> by <b>averaging its predicted coordinates across all voxel windows</b> in which it appeared.

After generating the <b>predicted atomic positions</b>, I compared them with those obtained from <b>DFT relaxation</b>. The resulting <b>deposition images</b> from both methods showed <b>strong visual and structural agreement</b>, confirming the CNN’s <b>ability to accurately reproduce the relaxed atomic arrangements</b>. Notably, this <b>predictive capability scaled to much larger systems</b>, where traditional simulations become computationally prohibitive.

In conclusion, by <b>integrating a Convolutional Neural Network into my modeling workflow</b>, I developed a <b>highly effective method for predicting the final deposition pattern</b> of metals on semiconductor surfaces. My model <b>captured the complex spatial relationships and physical interactions</b> within the system, offering a <b>fast, scalable, and physically grounded alternative</b> to conventional relaxation methods for <b>large-scale atomic systems</b>. <b>This model significantly accelerated computational calculations, reducing the need for time-consuming simulations. Instead, it produced highly accurate results by multiplying the model’s learned weights with the input tensors, effectively reconstructing the atomic positions. These predicted coordinates were then used to generate morphology images that closely resembled those obtained from traditional DFT-based relaxation</b>.

  <li><b>I collaborated with the Department of Statistics to research and investigate how graph convolutional neural networks can enhance the accuracy of predictions. I examined the accuracy of predictions on a truncated dataset in our experiments.</b> I analyzed predictions made by averaging the parameters of two truncated datasets to determine whether performance improvement could be observed. This analysis was conducted by applying the methodological framework of the Simplified <b>Graph Convolutional Neural Network (SGC)</b> to the Cora dataset. 

  I investigated the impact of node removal on prediction accuracy by selecting nodes based on three distinct patterns. The insights gained from these experiments revealed which node patterns are crucial for optimizing the performance of <b>SGC</b>. I demonstrated that when node removal is focused on a localized selection, <b>SGC</b> effectively utilizes the local information of network nodes. In this scenario, the applied method of improving <b>SGC</b>’s accuracy outperformed cases where nodes were randomly dropped.

  <li><b>I introduced a novel method to model the electrolyte at the electrochemical interface using ab initio simulations of charge transfer processes at surfaces.</b> I presented a simple capacitor model of the interface that addresses key challenges, including: i) the requirement for large cell heights to achieve convergence, <b>which incurs significant computational costs</b>, and ii) the costly iterative calculations of reaction energetics needed to tune the surface charge to the desired potential. 

  I derived a correction to the energy for finite cell heights, enabling the calculation of large cell energies without additional computational expense. Furthermore, I demonstrated that reaction energetics determined at constant charge can be easily mapped to those at constant potential, eliminating the need for iterative schemes to tune the system to a constant potential. 

  This work provided an efficient and accurate approach to modeling electrochemical interfaces.</li>

  <li> In my recent research, I explored the <b>Hydrogen Evolution Reaction (HER)</b>, a <b>key process in water splitting and clean energy conversion</b>. HER can proceed through different mechanisms depending on the electrolyte’s pH, but under neutral conditions, the <b>Volmer step</b>, where a <b>hydrogen atom adsorbs onto the electrode surface</b>, is the <b>rate-limiting step</b>. Because of this, my work specifically focuses on <b>understanding and improving this critical part of the reaction</b>.

In a <b>joint experimental and computational study</b>, I discovered that <b>non-metallic cations</b>, particularly <b>ammonium (NH₄⁺)</b> and <b>methylammonium (CH₃NH₃⁺)</b>, <b>significantly enhance HER activity</b> on a <b>gold (Au(111)) surface</b> compared to the <b>metallic sodium ion (Na⁺)</b>. These findings raised an important question: <b>what makes non-metallic cations more effective at promoting HER?</b>

To answer this, I employed <b>Grand Canonical Density Functional Theory (GC-DFT)</b>, using the <b>TPOT package</b> in conjunction with <b>VASP and VASPsol</b>. This method allows the <b>number of electrons to adjust dynamically</b> during the simulation to maintain a <b>constant electrode potential</b>. I also used a <b>realistic solvent model</b> with <b>40 water molecules</b> and a <b>4×4×5 Au(111) slab</b> to simulate the electrolyte environment, and applied a <b>slow-growth approach</b> to calculate the <b>activation barriers</b> of the reaction.

Through these simulations, I found that <b>hydrogen can adsorb on the electrode surface via two general pathways</b>: from the <b>dissociation of water molecules within the cation’s hydration shell</b> or from <b>bulk water outside of it</b>. However, in systems with <b>non-metallic cations</b>, I identified <b>two additional mechanisms</b>: <b>direct cation splitting</b> and <b>proton shuttling</b>. These <b>unique pathways lower the energy barrier</b> for hydrogen adsorption, helping to <b>accelerate the HER</b>.

Overall, my results show that the <b>identity of the cation plays a critical role</b> in the <b>HER mechanism and efficiency</b>. <b>Non-metallic cations like NH₄⁺ and CH₃NH₃⁺</b> not only <b>lower activation barriers</b>, but also <b>introduce new proton transfer routes</b> not available with traditional metal cations. This insight could <b>open up new directions for catalyst design</b> in <b>future energy technologies</b>.

  <li><b>I investigated the cation effect using small quaternary ammonium cations with different sizes and symmetries.</b> For Bi-catalyzed CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction Reaction (CO<sub>2</sub>RR), which produces CO and formate, I performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to examine the effect of asymmetric cations (such as CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup>) on CO<sub>2</sub> adsorption and activation.

  My findings were supported by experimental studies, which confirmed that asymmetric cations have a stronger promotional effect on CO<sub>2</sub>RR activity compared to symmetric ones. This effect is attributed to the asymmetric and weak hydration shell that stabilizes adsorbed CO<sub>2</sub>. Additionally, by comparing cations of different sizes (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, Me<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup>, and Et<sub>4</sub>N<sup>+</sup>), I observed a significant effect of cation size on CO production activity, with negligible impact on formate production.

  My work further elucidated the critical effects of cation symmetry and size on CO<sub>2</sub>RR and proposed a method to improve electrocatalysis through optimized electrolytes. <b>This research led to the publication of a paper.</b></li>

  <li><b>I studied and reported the effect of creating an interface between a semiconducting polyaniline polymer or a polar poly-D-lysine molecular film and one of two valence tautomeric complexes, i.e., [CoIII(SQ)(Cat)(4-CN-py)2] ↔ [CoII(SQ)2(4-CN-py)2] and [CoIII(SQ)(Cat)(3-tpp)2] ↔ [CoII(SQ)2(3-tpp)2].</b> I identified the electronic transitions and orbitals using X-ray photoemission, X-ray absorption, inverse photoemission, and optical absorption spectroscopy measurements, guided by density functional theory. 

  My findings revealed that, except for slightly modified binding energies and shifted orbital levels, the choice of the underlying substrate layer had little effect on the electronic structure. Additionally, I observed a prominent unoccupied ligand-to-metal charge transfer state in [CoIII(SQ)(Cat)(3-tpp)2] ↔ [CoII(SQ)2(3-tpp)2], which remained virtually insensitive to the interface between the polymer and tautomeric complexes in the Co(II) high-spin state.

<p> For my master’s research, I integrated <b>deep learning methodologies to unravel the mysteries of supersymmetry and dark matter</b>. While the Standard Model is foundational to modern particle physics, it falls short in addressing the <b>hierarchy problem</b>—the disparity between electroweak and gravitational forces. <b>Supersymmetry</b>, a hypothetical extension of the Standard Model, offers a compelling solution to this problem. At the core of my research is the exploration of the <b>Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (LSP)</b>, a theoretical entity with profound implications for <b>dark matter</b>.

<b>Employing advanced deep learning techniques</b>, I calculated the <b>cross-section for the scattering of dark matter particles from ordinary matter</b>, shedding light on the elusive nature of dark matter. My investigation spanned both <b>direct and indirect detection methods</b>, where I performed a thorough analysis of experimental setups and conducted <b>rigorous comparisons between theoretical predictions and astronomical observations</b>. Using <b>data science methodologies</b>, I validated the robustness of my model, ensuring it aligned with real-world data.

In the domain of <b>direct dark matter detection</b>, I <b>developed and trained a deep neural network</b> specifically designed to identify the <b>cross-section of dark matter particles</b>, using data collected from <b>Fermi-LAT</b>. The sophisticated structure and function of this <b>neural network</b> significantly improved the precision and reliability of insights into dark matter interactions.

My research also extended into <b>indirect detection methods</b>, including the study of <b>annihilated dark matter particles</b> and the detection of <b>neutrinos and photons</b>. In this context, I built and deployed another <b>neural network</b> that was instrumental in <b>confirming the exclusive origins of neutrinos from specific particle interactions</b>. These networks became central to my work, serving as <b>critical tools within a broader data science framework</b>, used to refine and test theoretical models against real-world cosmic data.

Ultimately, my work led to a <b>comprehensive understanding of the interplay between supersymmetry and dark matter</b>, with <b>data science emerging as the key enabler</b> in decoding these cosmic mysteries.</p>

                             My undergraduate thesis was grounded in a published research paper produced by a team of researchers, which I thoroughly studied, reproduced, and restructured into an original and comprehensive presentation. Building on that foundation, I conducted an in-depth investigation into the <b>decomposition reactions of the neutral pion (&pi;<sup>0</sup>)</b>, analyzing not only the different decay channels but also the <b>probabilities associated with each reaction pathway</b>. As part of my research, I undertook a detailed study of the <b>Tevatron accelerator</b> and its <b>trace detection systems</b>, including the <b>CDF (Collider Detector at Fermilab)</b>, <b>SVXII</b>, <b>ISL (Intermediate Silicon Layers)</b>, and <b>COT (Central Outer Tracker)</b>. These detectors are designed to trace the trajectories of charged particles, and I focused on their structure and operational dynamics. I also examined the <b>&gamma; &rarr; e<sup>-</sup> e<sup>+</sup></b> conversion process within the Tevatron, aiming to minimize uncertainty in the <b>initial conversion probability</b>. To accomplish this, I developed an <b>algorithm</b> that enabled the <b>reconstruction of the &pi;<sup>0</sup> mass</b> by combining four distinct particle trajectories. This reconstruction allowed me to determine the <b>cleavage position of the &pi;<sup>0</sup></b>. I further explored the feasibility of using <b>spatial variables</b> in analyzing &pi;<sup>0</sup> decay modes, including both <b>normal and Dalitz decays</b>, while deeply examining their <b>topologies</b>. Throughout this process, I identified and defined the most effective spatial variables, <b>firstpoint</b> and <b>minpoint</b>, as critical features in my analysis. Here, the <b>Monte Carlo technique</b> played a pivotal role in simulating and validating my results. Finally, using the resulting decay topology diagrams, I was able to <b>identify and distinguish the ISL, COT, and SVXII detectors</b>, effectively linking theory, simulation, and detector response.
