                                <ul>
                                    <li> Introduced a second generation neural-network representation that is several orders of magnitude faster than Density Functional Theory (DFT). This method, relies on local properties and is not taking into account global changes in the electronic structure. This representation gives the energy and forces as a function of all atomic positions in systems of any size. An atomic neural network uses the local chemical environment to determine each atom’s energy. A feed-forward neural network, in which information only passes in one direction toward the output layer, is the sort of neural network that is used for fitting energy. There are two layers: an input layer that feeds the network with the respective atomic positions and an output layer that holds the atomic potential energy. The regression is carried out by a number of intermediary hidden layers, with the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer being empirically optimized for the particular application. </ul>

                                    <li>Introduced a fourth-generation high-dimensional neural network potential that combines a charge equilibration scheme employing environment-dependent atomic electronegativities with accurate atomic energies.The technique produces far better energies and significantly broadens the applicability of contemporary machine learning potentials since it can accurately characterize global charge distributions in arbitrary systems. Electronic structural calculations and the potential of fourth-generation neural networks accord quite well.</ul>

                                <li> Worked with Dr Talat Rahman and Dr Duy Le and Introduced a novel method to model the electrolyte at the electrochemical interface using initio simulations of charge transfer processes at surfaces. We presented a simple capacitor model of the interface that illuminates how to circumvent i) required large cell heights to reach convergence, which is a serious computational cost ii) the costly iterations calculations of reaction energetics to tune the surface charge to the desired potential. We derived a correction to the energy for finite cell heights to obtain the large cell energies at no additional computational expense. We furthermore demonstrated that the reaction energetics determined at constant charge are easily mapped to those at constant potential, which eliminates the need to apply iterative schemes to tune the system to a constant potential.

                                    CO2 from ambient air. Developed model which predicts that significant absorption of CO<sub>2</sub> happens bellow -1.5 V and therefore, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup> is a good catalyst to be used at Bismuth filters for CO<sub>2</sub> gas. That was a novel result, never seen before and recently experimentally confirmed.

                            It is an original material which I research and discover on my own. According to my master thesis, a brief reference is made to the standard model, the problem of the hierarchy is analyzed and reference is made to the way in which supersymmetry can respond to this problem. I then examine how the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is the main reason I have mentioned supersymmetry in the first chapter of my work, can be connected to dark matter. After the cross section for the scattering of the particles of the dark matter from ordinary matter is calculated, a detailed analysis of the direct dark mater detection modes is performed and analysis is made of the ways in which experiments that aim at dark matter detection work. Finally, indirect ways of detecting dark matter from annihilated dark matter particles to neutrinos and photons are examined. I allways compare theoretical predictions to data from observational astronomy in order to check the validity of the model which I am using.

                            It was based on research paper that has been produced by other reinformation searchers. I had to study it, reproduce it and piece it an original presentation. According to my undergraduate thesis, reference is made not only to the decomposition reactions of &pi; <sup>0</sup>,  but also to the probability that occurs in each of them. A study is also made to a detailed analysis of the structure and mode of operation of the Tevatron accelerator and of the CDF (Collider Detector at Fermilab), SVXII, ISL (Silicon Layers) and COT (Central Outer Tracker) detectors, which are the trace detection systems and are designed to detect the charged particle trajectories. Next, the conversion of &gamma; &rarr; e <sup> - </sup> e<sup> + </sup> to Tevatron is studied to reduce the uncertainty in the initial conversion probability. The above procedure is done by creating an algorithm. From the reconstruction of the mass of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> and from the combination of the four trajectories, I find the cleavage position of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> . Then we analyze the possibility of using the space variables in the decomposition of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> while analyzing the topology of both normal and Daliz &pi; <sup> 0 </sup>. After the study we come to the selection of the appropriate variables which are defined as firstpoint and minpoint, where Monte Carlo technic plaid a crucial role. Finally, from the diagram that emerged from the breakpoints of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> , we proceeded to identify the ISL, COT and SVXII detectors.
