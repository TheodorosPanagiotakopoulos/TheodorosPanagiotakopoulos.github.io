                    <p>
                    I am currently getting my PhD in computational physics from the University of Central Florida and more precisely I am evolved in machine learning with applications in nanotechnology and material science. I am passionate about coding with strong business understanding, I love diving into problems and extensively reaching all their different aspects. <br>

<p>
My field of research is the creation of neural network potentials for molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. Apart from this, I am also working with the department of Statistics on the development of Graphical neural networks, where we  utilize flexible constraints to produce a smaller set of weights that help simplify the inference process and highlight important features for the users. I am skilled in quarantine analysis, Statistical Data Science, Computational Physics, Computational Modeling, Predictive Analytics and well trained in the field of neural networks such as deep learning and GANs. I also have big experience with time series analysis and forecasting by using AR, ARIMA and deep learning.<br> </p>


Moreover, I am an experienced Teaching Assistant with a demonstrated history of working in the higher education industry and I have been teaching graduate and undergraduate courses at the University of Central Florida. I also have a Master's degree focused in computational physics from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.

                                    <li> <b> Introduced a second generation neural-network representation that is several orders of magnitude faster than Density Functional Theory (DFT)</b>. This method, relies on local properties and is not taking into account global changes in the electronic structure. This representation gives the energy and forces as a function of all atomic positions in systems of any size. An atomic neural network uses the local chemical environment to determine each atom’s energy. A feed-forward neural network, in which information only passes in one direction toward the output layer, is the sort of neural network that is used for fitting energy. There are two layers: an input layer that feeds the network with the respective atomic positions and an output layer that holds the atomic potential energy. The regression is carried out by a number of intermediary hidden layers, with the number of layers and the number of neurons in each layer being empirically optimized for the particular application. </ul>

It consists of highly accurate short-range atomic energies similar to those used in second generation <b> neural networks</b> potentials and charges determined from a charge equilibration method relying on electronegativities. Both, the short-range atomic energies as well as the electronegativities are expressed by atomic <b> neural networks </b> as a function of the chemical environments. For all these systems we demonstrate that fourth generation <b>neural network </b> potentials trained to DFT data are able to provide reliable energies, forces and charges in excellent agreement with electronic structure calculations. We show that previous generations of <b> neural network </b> potentials, which are unable to take distant structural changes into account, yield inaccurate energies and forces, which are correctly resolved by this  <b> neural network </b> potential.

Moreover, the island areas grew linearly with time, exhibiting collective diffusion, and their total growth rate was inversely related to the temperature. Density Functional Theory simulations of the chemical potential and binding sites of the Pb/Ge(111) system were used to explain this nonclassical behavior of the system. </ul>

We derived a correction to the energy for finite cell heights to obtain the large cell energies at no additional computational expense. We furthermore demonstrated that the reaction energetics determined at constant charge are easily mapped to those at constant potential, which eliminates the need to apply iterative schemes to tune the system to a constant potential.

                                    <li> Studied and reported the effect of creating an interface between a semiconducting polyaniline polymer or a polar poly-D-lysine molecular film and one of two valence tautomeric complexes, i.e., [CoIII(SQ)(Cat)(4-CN-py)2] ↔ [CoII(SQ)2(4-CN-py)2] and [CoIII(SQ)(Cat)(3-tpp)2] ↔ [CoII(SQ)2(3-tpp)2]. The electronic transitions and orbitals are identified using X-ray photoemission, X-ray absorption, inverse photoemission, and optical absorption spectroscopy measurements that are guided by density functional theory. Except for slightly modified binding energies and shifted orbital levels, the choice of the underlying substrate layer has little effect on the electronic structure. A prominent unoccupied ligand-to-metal charge transfer state exists in [CoIII(SQ)(Cat)(3-tpp)2] ↔ [CoII(SQ)2(3-tpp)2] that is virtually insensitive to the interface between the polymer and tautomeric complexes in the Co(II) high-spin state  </ul>

                            It is an original material which I research and discover on my own. According to my master thesis, a brief reference is made to the standard model, the problem of the hierarchy is analyzed and reference is made to the way in which supersymmetry can respond to this problem. I then examine how the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP), which is the main reason I have mentioned supersymmetry in the first chapter of my work, can be connected to dark matter. After the cross section for the scattering of the particles of the dark matter from ordinary matter is calculated, a detailed analysis of the direct dark mater detection modes is performed and analysis is made of the ways in which experiments that aim at dark matter detection work. Finally, indirect ways of detecting dark matter from annihilated dark matter particles to neutrinos and photons are examined. I allways compare theoretical predictions to data from observational astronomy in order to check the validity of the model which I am using.

                            It was based on research paper that has been produced by other reinformation searchers. I had to study it, reproduce it and piece it an original presentation. According to my undergraduate thesis, reference is made not only to the decomposition reactions of &pi; <sup>0</sup>,  but also to the probability that occurs in each of them. A study is also made to a detailed analysis of the structure and mode of operation of the Tevatron accelerator and of the CDF (Collider Detector at Fermilab), SVXII, ISL (Silicon Layers) and COT (Central Outer Tracker) detectors, which are the trace detection systems and are designed to detect the charged particle trajectories. Next, the conversion of &gamma; &rarr; e <sup> - </sup> e<sup> + </sup> to Tevatron is studied to reduce the uncertainty in the initial conversion probability. The above procedure is done by creating an algorithm. From the reconstruction of the mass of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> and from the combination of the four trajectories, I find the cleavage position of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> . Then we analyze the possibility of using the space variables in the decomposition of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> while analyzing the topology of both normal and Daliz &pi; <sup> 0 </sup>. After the study we come to the selection of the appropriate variables which are defined as firstpoint and minpoint, where Monte Carlo technic plaid a crucial role. Finally, from the diagram that emerged from the breakpoints of &pi;<sup> 0 </sup> , we proceeded to identify the ISL, COT and SVXII detectors.

                    <p>Apart from being a data scientist, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I enjoy boxing and gym, while during the warmer months, I enjoy biking, free climbing, and surfing.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of action movies and television shows, I enjoy cooking, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world. .</p>
